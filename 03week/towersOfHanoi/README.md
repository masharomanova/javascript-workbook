-Get user input (startStack, endStack) and then check for rules of the game based on the current stack object

-Whenever we want to move a number we need to check its value and make sure it's less than the number you're trying to place it on

-To move a number need to update the stacks object using our user input that we get (startStack, endStack)

-Don't check for a win on column A (MAKE INTO TEST QUESTION)

-To determine a win, check that all the numbers are on one column ('b' or 'c') (MAKE INTO TEST QUESTION) has all the numbers in descending order (greatest to least)

-Should only be able to remove a number from the end of an array and placed on the end of another array

-We can always move numbers into an empty array

-If you choose from an empty stack or one that doesn't exist, the stacks won't be updated and a message will be logged to the console
